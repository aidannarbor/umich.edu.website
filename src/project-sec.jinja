<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>
Society for the Education of the Crippled or SEC educates and rehabilitates children and adults with physical and multiple disabilities from low economic groups. The Society for the Education of the Crippled (Child and Adult) was founded by Fathema Ismail in 1958. Fathema’s concern for the physically handicapped came from her personal experience as the mother of a polio-affected child whom she wanted to rehabilitate medically and educationally. She was successful in her efforts as her daughter was able to lead a normal life.
Fathema Ismail began with a personal contribution of Rs. 40,000 to start the school. The school and her work progressed thereafter with the donations received from well-wishers. A sense of proper school setting was experienced with the establishment of the Agripada unit of the school. There was a bell indicating periods for different classes, and proper desks and classrooms were set up. More teachers were employed for the thirty students. At that time, the Ex-students formed and ran the Association.

<h4>Achievements</h4>

<p>
Ganesha gazes benevolently out of the painting, beautifully executed against a swirling backdrop of muted greens, creams, and greys. Would you believe the artist has a congenital anomaly that caused him to be born with no arms, and that he accomplished all those expertly rendered brush strokes with his feet? The artist, Bandenawaz, is a product of the Society of Education for the Crippled (SEC), which caters to handicapped and severely crippled children whose families cannot arrange for the schooling of their special needs children, or pay the annual fees. Bandenawaz, whose family almost sold him to a circus before his mother had a last minute change of heart, is a prime example. Even after the family decided to keep Bandenawaz, no school would accept him because of his special needs. When he came to the SEC, the school found him a sponsor to foster his love of painting, and hone his skills.

<h4>Work:</h4>
<p>
SEC has 16 Board members and Volunteers. The school has 3 centers. We visited the school at Aptop hill - a slum area in Wadala. The place really looked like a slum .The School is in a Government municipal Building. The top floor is a regular school and the ground floor is SEC. The Government demands nominal rent.
</p>
<p>
SEC started with its first batch of 13 students in the year 1958. Today it has more than 300 on its roll. The classes are from Nursery level to the seventh standard (grade). The curriculum followed by the school is as per the Maharashtra State Board.The medium of instructions in the school is Hindi and Marathi. 
</p>
<p>
Specially trained teachers try to simplify the content of all the subjects taught to the children and give individual attention to them.After the seventh grade the children are integrated in to normal schools elsewhere, but SEC follows up with regular progress reports. SEC arranges for special guidance or tuitions if required.
</p>
When the children of SEC clear their Maharashtra Board examination, SEC feels that a part of their mission is fulfilled.
